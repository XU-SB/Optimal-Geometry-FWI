# Optimal-Geometry-FWI
 This repository provides tools for optimal acquisition geometry design for Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), applicable to both land and marine seismic surveys. It focuses on evaluating source–receiver layouts through physics-based modeling and imaging metrics to quantify geometry-controlled imaging capability and stability.
